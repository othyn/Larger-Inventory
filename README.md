# Larger-Inventory
A Factorio mod: https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Othyn/Larger%20Inventory%20Updated

Original Mod (<= 0.14): http://www.factorioforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=5891

I would create a pull request, but the mod name had to be changed to get it onto the mod portal and the difference is minimal.

Edit (20/04/17): Rseding91 (via Reddit PM) has kindly given permission for this mod to stay updated.
